# Tutorial: basics of using WoC

In order to provide you with the access to the systems, please fill
[WoC registration form http://bit.ly/WoCSignup](http://bit.ly/WoCSignup).

### MOOC on using shell script

Please consider auditing this course if you are not comfortable working with the terminal/shell script

[Unix Tools: Data, Software and Production Engineering](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+UnixTx+1T2020/course/)

### Before the Tutorial: Access to da server(s)

To register for the hackathon/tutorial, please
generate a public key.
For Mac and unix users the instructions below would work, but for windows users 
the best option is to enable [ubuntu shell]](https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-enable-ubuntu-bash-in-windows-10) [other instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) first, then follow instructions for unix/mac. Alternatively, 
[OpenSSH module for PowerShell](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-in-openssh-for-windows-10/), or
[Git-Bash](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows#Git-Bash) are other options.

To generated ssh key open a terminal window and run `ssh-keygen` command. Once
it completes it produces the `id_rsa.pub` and `id_rsa` files inside your $HOME/.ssh/ folder. 
Type
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
That is your public ssh key you include in the WoC registration [form http://bit.ly/WoCSignup](http://bit.ly/WoCSignup). The form will ask you for the contents of `id_rsa.pub` and the
GitHub and BitBucket handles. You will receive a response to the
email provided in the form once your account is set up.

Set up your `~/.ssh/config` file so that you can login to one of the da servers without having to fully specify the server name each time:
```
Host *
  ForwardAgent yes

Host da0
	Hostname da0.eecs.utk.edu
	Port 443
	User YourUsername
	
```
YourUsername is the login name you provided on the signup form. 
Logging in then becomes as simple as typing `ssh da0` in your terminal.

### Set up accounts for GitHub and Bitbucket

If you dont have these already, please setup an account on both
GitHub and Bitbucket (they will be needed to invite you to the
relevant repositories on GitHub&BitBucket).
GitHub: https://github.com/pricing  
BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/  

## Tutorial Objectives

Prepare for the hackathon, make sure connections work, 
get familiar with the basic functionality, and potential of WoC, 
start thinking on how to investigate global relationships
in open source.  

### WoC Objectives

Do the hard work to enable research on global properties of FLOSS: 

* Census of all FLOSS
   - What is out there, of what kind, how much
   - Ability to select projects/developers for natural experiments/other empirical studies 
* Provide FLOSS-wide relationships
   - Technical dependencies (to run applications)
   - Tool dependencies (to build/test applications)
   - Code migration
   - Knowledge (and people) migration
* Data Cleaned/Augmented/Contextualized
   - Correction: Authors/Forks/Outliers
   - Augmentation: Dependencies/Linking to other data sources
   - Context: project types/expertise
* Big Data Analytics: Map entities to all related entities efficiently
* Timely: Targeting < 1 week old analyzable snapshot of the entire FLOSS
* Community run
   - Hackathon will help determine community needs
   - [Hackathon Schedule](https://github.com/woc-hack/schedule)
* How to participate?
   - Hackathon registration [form](http://bit.ly/WoC-Signup)
   - If you can not attend the hackathon but just want to try out WoC, please fill the hackathon form but indicate in the topic section is that you do not plan to attend the hackathon.

## Activity 1: Access to da server(s)

Log in: `ssh da0`.

Once you are in a da server, you will have an empty directory under `/home/username` where you can store your programs and files:  
```
-bash-4.2$ pwd
/home/username
-bash-4.2$ 
```

Set up your shell:
```
-bash-4.2$ echo 'exec bash' >> .profile
-bash-4.2$ echo 'export PS1="\u@\h:\w>"' >> ~/.bashrc
-bash-4.2$ . .bashrc
[username@da0]~%
```

You can also login to other da servers, but first need to set up an ssh key on these systems:
```
[username@da0]~% ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/niravajmeri/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/niravajmeri/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/niravajmeri/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:/UoJkpnx5mn8jx4BhcnQRUFfPq4qmC1MVLRJSjpYnpo niravajmeri@da0.eecs.utk.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|    . o=o**.  .  |
|   + + o*+ . o   |
|  . = o.+   . o  |
|   o ..* o   . . |
|  E  .= S o   .  |
|      .= o + .   |
|     o += + o    |
|      =.oo =     |
|       . o*..    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
Once the key is generated add it to your .ssh/auhorized_keys
```
[username@da0]~% cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys 
```

Now you can login to da4:
```
[username@da0]~% ssh da4
[username@da4]~% 
```

#### Exercise 1

Log in to da0 and clone two repositories that contain APIs to access WoC data
```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup
git clone https://github.com/ssc-oscar/oscar.py
```

Log in to da4 from da0:
```
[username@da0]~% ssh da4
[username@da4]~% ls
...
[username@da4]~% exit
[username@da0]~%
```


## Activity 2: Shell APIs - Basic Operations


Shell APIs might be useful to accsess content of the commit, trees, blobs, 
to calculate the diff produced by a commit, etc. 

For more examples [see full API](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/README.md). 

Lets look at the commit 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a:

```
[username@da0]~% echo 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a | ~/lookup/showCnt commit
tree 464ac950171f673d1e45e2134ac9a52eca422132
parent dddff9a89ddd7098a1625cafd3c9d1aa87474cc7
author Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org> 1092638038 +0000
committer Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org> 1092638038 +0000

Don't need to declare cbb module.  don't know why I never saw
duplicate messages..
```

This commit has a tree and a parent commit and is created by 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>'. 
Lets inspect the tree (the root folder of the project):
```
[username@da0]~% echo 464ac950171f673d1e45e2134ac9a52eca422132 | ~/lookup/showCnt tree
100644;a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999;COPYRIGHT
...
040000;6618176f9f37fa3e62f2efd953c07096f8ecf6db;usr.sbin
```

We may also want inspect the first element in the tree: blob representing file COPYRIGHT
```
[username@da0]~% echo a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999 | ~/lookup/showCnt blob
blob;40;2999;66321199427;66321199427;2999;a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999
# $FreeBSD$
#  @(#)COPYRIGHT  8.2 (Berkeley) 3/21/94
...
```

### Exercise 2

Determine the author of the parent commit for commit 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a

Hint 1: parent commit is listed in the content of commit 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a above
```
echo dddff9a89ddd7098a1625cafd3c9d1aa87474cc7 | ~/lookup/showCnt commit
```

### Summary 2

Synopsis:
```
~/lookup/showCnt commit|tree|blob
```
reads from the standard input sha1 of the corresponding objects and 
prints the content of these objects. Blob objects are preceeded by a line
that can be used to recognize the object, e.g., blob 2f6e8c1336f6667eb86b60dd2aae5a63827329fd
by:
```
blob;47;15472287;328027352742;328027352742;15472287;2f6e8c1336f6667eb86b60dd2aae5a63827329fd
```
blob, database (0-127), length compressed, length uncompressed, length uncompressed and compressed as recorded in the database, sha1

## Activity 3 - Investigate the maps

We see the content of the copyright file above. Such files are often copied verbatim. Lets determine the first author who have created it (irrespective of a repository).
WoC has created this relationship and stored in b2a (Blob to Author) map:
```
[username@da0]~% echo a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999 |  ~/lookup/getValues b2a
a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999;1072910122;Warner Losh <imp@ccf9f872-aa2e-dd11-9fc8-001c23d0bc1f>;00a8f599c25ded714d2a4da9e1bb30e2a335181c
```
It turns out that it was created by commit 00a8f599c25ded714d2a4da9e1bb30e2a335181c done by what appears to be the same author on unix second 1072910122.

What is b2a? The letters signify what keys (b - Blob) and values (a - author) means. These are key objects: 
* a = Author
* b = Blob
* c = Commit
* f = File
* p = Project


We may also ask if this blob has been widely copied as would be expected for copyright files:
```
[username@da0]~% echo a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999 |  ~/lookup/getValues b2c
a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999;00729b406d8d3cfeeeda61c4586dcfd9f9399f4a;00a8f599c25ded714d2a4da9e1bb30e2a335181c;...
```
b2c (blob to commit) shows the numerous commits that introduced that blob in all repositories. We can further use commit to project map (c2p)
to identify all associated projects:
```
[username@da0]~% echo a8fe822f075fa3d159a203adfa40c3f59d6dd999 |  \
~/lookup/getValues b2c | \
perl -ane 's/^[^;];//;s/;/\n/g;print' | \
~/lookup/getValues c2p | \
perl -ane 's/^[^;];//;s/;/\n/g;print' 
ajburton_freebsd
bu7cher_freebsd
denghuancong_freebsd
...
```
In fact there are 1072 distinct repositories where this blob appears.

Finally, we have the author 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>' for the commit we have investigated. 
Can we find what other commits Warner has made?:
```
[username@da0]~% echo 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>' | ~/lookup/getValues a2c
Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;0000ce4417bd8d9a2d66a7a61393558d503f2805;000109ae96e7132d90440c8fa12cb7df95a806c6;00014b72bf10ad43ca437daf388d33c4fea73df9;000171c80d0d0ab6ff22b58b922e559e51485936;000282fc6c091e1c0abdadf1f58c088fc3ed9bc9;0002d1cab0d367c074a601e28183c60657254820;000373a8c48347c3e0e30486ccf4d9b043438826;...

```

In addition to variable-length records (key;val1,;val2;...;valn), 
the output can be produced as a flat table (key;val1\nkey;val2\n...\nkey;valn)
using -f option:
```
[username@da0]~% echo 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>' | ~/lookup/getValues -f a2c
Warner Losh echo 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>' | ~/lookup/getValues -f a2c| head
Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;0000ce4417bd8d9a2d66a7a61393558d503f2805
Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;000109ae96e7132d90440c8fa12cb7df95a806c6
...
```



In addition to the random lookup, the maps are also stored in flat sorted files and this format is preffered (faster) when investigating over one million items. 
For example, find commits by any author named Warner: 
```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/basemaps/gz/a2cFullP0.s | grep 'Warner'
```
As described below, the maps are split into 32 parts to enable parallel search.
FullP means that we are looking ata  complete extract at version P. 


### Exercise 3

a) Find all files modified by 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>'

Hint 1: What is the map name?

Author to File or a2f
```
echo 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>' | ~/lookup/getValues a2f 
```

Find all commits  developers who have your last and your first name:

Hint 1: use wc (word count), e.g., 

```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/basemaps/gz/a2cFullP*.s | grep -i 'audris' | grep -i 'mockus' | wc -l
```

### Summary 3
For any key provided on standard input, a list of values is provided
```
~/lookup/getValue [-f] a2c|c2a|b2c|c2b|b2f|f2b|c2f|f2c|p2c|c2p
```
option -f replaces one output line per input line into the number of lines corresponding to the number of values. 

Also, only the first column of the input is considered as the key, other fields are passed through, e.g., 
```
echo 'Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;zz' | ~/lookup/getValues -f a2c| head
Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;zz;0000ce4417bd8d9a2d66a7a61393558d503f2805
Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>;zz;000109ae96e7132d90440c8fa12cb7df95a806c6
...
```

## Activity 4: Using Python APIs from oscar.py

Important Note: If you experience any difficulties in retrieving data from oscar.py's function calls (i.e., you receive an empty tuple on function return), please run `git pull` in your cloned repo to stay up-to-date with the latest version of oscar.py.   

These are corresponding functions in oscar.py that open the .tch files listed below for a given entity. "/<function_name>" after a function name denotes the version of that function that returns a Generator object.

1. `Author('...')`  - initialized with a combination of name and email
	* `.blobs`
	* `.commit_shas/commits`
	* `.project_names`
	* `.files`
	* `.torvald` - returns the torvald path of an Author, i.e, who did this Author work
				 with that also worked with Linus Torvald
2. `Blob('...')` -  initialized with SHA of blob
	* `.author` - returns timestamp, author name, and binary SHA of commit
	* `.commit_shas/commits` - commits removing this blob are not included
	* `.data` - content of the blob
	* `.file_sha(filename)` - compute blob sha from a file content
	* `.position` - get offset and length of blob data in storage
	* `.parent`
	* `.string_sha(string)`
	* `.tkns` - result of ctags run on this blob, if there were any
3. `Commit('...')` - initialized with SHA of commit
	* `.blob_shas/blobs`
	* `.child_shas/children`
	* `.changed_file_names/files_changed`
	* `.parent_shas/parents`
	* `.project_names/projects`
	* `.reporoot` - original repository for this commit
	* `.tdiff`
4. `Commit_info('...')` - initialized like Commit()
	* `.head`
	* `.time_author`
5. `File('...')` - initialized with a path, starting from a commit root tree
	* `.authors`
	* `.blobs`
	* `.commit_shas/commits`
6. `Project('...')` - initialized with project name/URI
	* `.author_names`
	* `.commit_shas/commits`
	* `.fork_commits` - like `commit_shas`, but also accounts for forks
7. `Tdiff('...')` - initialized with SHA, result of diff run on 2 blobs (if there was a diff)
	* `.commit`
	* `.file`
8. `Tree('...')` - representation of a git tree object (dir), initialized with SHA of tree
	* `.files`
	* `.blob_shas/blobs`
	* `.commit_shas/commits`
	* `.traverse`

The non-Generator version of these functions will return a tuple of items which can then be iterated:
```
for commit in Author(author_name).commit_shas:
	print(commit)
```

### Exercise 4a:  Get a list of commits made by a specific author:  

Install the latest oscar.py
```
[username@da0]~% cd ~/oscar.py
[username@da0]~% easy_install --user --upgrade oscar
```

As we learned before, we can do that in shell
```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/basemaps/gz/a2cFullP0.s | grep "Albert Krawczyk" <pro-logic@optusnet.com.au>
"Albert Krawczyk" <pro-logic@optusnet.com.au>;17abdbdc90195016442a6a8dd8e38dea825292ae
"Albert Krawczyk" <pro-logic@optusnet.com.au>;9cdc918bfba1010de15d0c968af8ee37c9c300ff
"Albert Krawczyk" <pro-logic@optusnet.com.au>;d9fc680a69198300d34bc7e31bbafe36e7185c76
```

Now the same thing can be done using oscar.py:  
```
[username@da0]~% cd oscar.py
[username@da0:oscar.py]~% python
>>> from oscar import Author
>>> Author('"Albert Krawczyk" <pro-logic@optusnet.com.au>').commit_shas
('17abdbdc90195016442a6a8dd8e38dea825292ae', '9cdc918bfba1010de15d0c968af8ee37c9c300ff', 'd9fc680a69198300d34bc7e31bbafe36e7185c76')
```

### Exercise 4b: Get the URL of a projects repository using the oscar.py `Project(...).toURL()` function:  
```
[username@da0:oscar.py]~%  python
>>> from oscar import Project
>>> Project('notcake_gcad').toURL()
'https://github.com/notcake/gcad'
```

### Exercise 4c

Get list of files modified by commit 17abdbdc90195016442a6a8dd8e38dea825292ae

Hint 1: What class to use?
Commit
```
[username@da0:oscar.py]~%  python
>>> from oscar import Commit
>>> Commit('17abdbdc90195016442a6a8dd8e38dea825292ae').changed_file_names
```

## Activity 5: Understanding Servers and folders

All home folders are on da2, so it is preferred not to do very large
file operations to/from these folders  when running tasks on servers
other than da2,
since these operations will load NFS and may slow access to home
folders of other users.

Each server has /data/play folder where you can create your
subfolders to store/process large files.

### List of relevant directories

Not all files are stored on all servers due to limited disk sizes
and different speed of disks. For example, blobs are stored only on
da4 and da5. 
The description below goes over what is stored on each server. 

### da0/da5 Servers
#### <relationship>.{0-31}.tch files in `/data/basemaps/` on da0 and /fast on da5:  
(.s) signifies that there are either .s or .gz versions of these files in gz/ subfolder, which can be opened with Python gzip module or Unix zcat.  
da0 is the only server with these .s/.gz files  
Keys for identifying letters:   

* a = Author
* b = Blob
* c = Commit
* cc = Child Commit
* f = File
* h = Head Commit
* ob = Parent Blob
* p = Project
* pc = Parent Commit
* P = Forked/Root Project (see Note below)
* ta = Time Author
* td = Tdiff
* tk = Tokens (ctags)
* trp = Torvalds Path

List of relationships:
```
* a2b 		* a2c (.s)	* a2f		* a2ft		
* a2p (.s)	* a2trp0 (.s)
* b2a		* b2c (.s)	* b2f (.s)	* b2ob		* b2tk
* c2b (.s)	* c2cc		* c2f (.s)	* c2h		* c2pc
* c2p (.s)	* c2P		* c2ta (.s)	* c2td
* f2a		* f2b (.s)	* f2c (.s)		
* p2a (.s)	* p2c (.s)	* P2c
* td2c		* td2f
```

Note: c2P returns the most central repository for this commit, and does not include repos that forked off of this commit. 
      P2c returns ALL commits associated with this repo, including commits made to forks of this particular repo. 

### Exercise 5

Find all blobs associated with Julia language files (extension .jl) 

Hint 1: What is the name of the map?

```
[username@da0] zcat /da0_data/basemaps/gz/f2bFullP*.s | grep '\.jl;'
```

## Activity 6: Investigating Technical dependencies

The technical dependencies have been extracted by parsing the content of all blobs related to 
several different languages: and are located in `/da0_data/play/${LANG}thruMaps/`.

These thruMaps directories contain mappings of repositories with modules that were utilized at a given UNIX timestamp under a specific commit. The mappings are in c2bPtaPkgP{$LANG}.{0-31}.gz files.   

The format of each file is: 
```
commit;repo_name;timestamp;author;blob;module1;module2;...`  
```


Each thruMaps directory has a different language ($LANG) that contains modules relevant to that language.

Lets get a list of commits and repositories that imported Tensorflow for .py files:  
```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/play/PYthruMaps/c2bPtaPkgPPY.0.gz | grep tensorflow`

```

### Exercise 6

Find all repositories using Julia language that import package 'StaticArrays'


Hint 1: What file to look for?
```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/play/jlthruMaps/c2bptaPkgOjl.*.gz | grep StaticArrays
```

Hint 2: What field contains the repository name?
```
[username@da0]~% zcat /da0_data/play/jlthruMaps/c2bptaPkgOjl.*.gz | grep StaticArrays | cut -d\; -f2 | sort -u
```

## Activity 7: Suggested by the audience

Find all projects that have commits mentioning "sql injection"

List of commits is on da4:/data/All.blobs/
Lets login to da4, create a data folder to store temporary data on the same server
"/data/play/username", and uce pcommit to project map to get the list of projects.

```
[username@da0]~% ssh da4
[username@da4]~% mkdir /data/play/audris
[username@da4]~% cd /data/play/audris
[username@da4:/data/play/audris]~% cut -d\; -f4 commit_*.idx | ~/lookup/showCmt.perl 2 | grep -i 'sql injection' > 
[username@da4:/data/play/audris]~% cut -d\; -f1 sql_inject | ~/lookup/getValues.perl /da0_data/basemaps/c2pFullP > sql_inject.c2p
```

## Activity 8: Summary of the activities undertaken

* Shell API (faster) and Python API (also Perl API not illustrated) for random access

* Sorted compressed tables for sweeps (grep)

* Key-Value maps to link authors, commits, files, projects, and blobs

## Self paced part of the tutorial

The remainig activities are provided to illustrate various realistic 
tasks. 

## Activity S0: Finding 1st-time imports for AI modules (Simple)

Given the data available, this is a fairly simple task. Making an application to detect the first time that a repo adopted an AI module would give you a better idea as to when it was first used, and also when it started to gain popularity.  

A good example of this lies in [popmods.py](https://github.com/ssc-oscar/aiframeworks/blob/master/popmods.py). In this application, we can read all 32 c2bPtaPkgO$LANG.{0-31}.gz files of a given language and look for a given module with the earliest import times. The program then creates a <module_name>.first file, with each line formatted as `repo_name;UNIX_timestamp`.  

Usage: `[username@da0]~%  python popmods.py language_file_extension module_name`  

Before anything else (and this can be applied to many other programs), you want to know what your input looks like ahead of time and know how you are going to parse it. Since each line of the file has this format:  
`commit;repo_name;timestamp;author;blob;module1;module2;...`  
We can use the `string.split()` method to turn this string into a list of words, split by a semicolon (;).  
By turning this line into a list, and giving it a variable name, `entry = ['commit', 'repo_name', 'timestamp', ...]`, we can then grab the pieces of information we need with `repo, time = entry[1], entry[2]`. 

An important idea to keep in mind is that we only want to count unique timestamps once. This is because we want to account for repositories that forked off of another repository with the exact timestamp of imports. An easy way to do this would be to keep a running list of the times we have come across, and if we have already seen that timestamp before, we will simply skip that line in the file:  
```
...
if time in times:
	continue
else:
	times.append(time)
...
```
We also want to find the earliest timestamp for a repository importing a given module. Again, this is fairly simple:  
```
...
if repo not in dict.keys() or time < dict[repo]:
	for word in entry[5:]:
		if module in word:
			dict[repo] = time
			break
...
```
#### Implementing the application

Now that we have the .first files put together, we can take this one step further and graph a modules first-time usage over time on a line graph, or even compare multiple modules to see how they stack up against each other. [modtrends.py](https://github.com/ssc-oscar/aiframeworks/blob/master/modtrends.py) accomplishes this by:  

* reading 1 or more .first files 
* converting each timestamp for each repository into a datetime date
* "rounding" those dates by year and month
* putting those dates in a dictionary with `dict["year-month"] += 1`
* graphing the dates and frequencies using matplotlib.

If you want to compare first-time usage over time for Tensorflow and
Keras for the .ipynb language .first files you created, run:
```
UNIX> python3.6 modtrends.py tensorflow.first keras.first
```
The final graph looks something like this:  
[![Tensorflow vs Keras](../ipynb_first/Tensorflow-vs-Keras.png "Tensorflow vs Keras")](https://github.com/ssc-oscar/aiframeworks/blob/master/charts/ipynb_charts/Tensorflow-vs-Keras.png)



## Activity S1: Detecting percentage language use and changes over time (Complex) 

An application to calculate this would be useful for seeing how different authors changed languages over a range of years, based on the commits they have made to different files.  
In order to accomplish this task, we will modify an existing program from the swsc/lookup repo ([a2fBinSorted.perl](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/a2fBinSorted.perl)) and create a new program ([a2L.py](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/a2L.py)) that will get language counts per year per author.  

#### Part 1 -- Modifying a2fBinSorted.perl
For the first part, we look at what a2fBinSorted.perl currently does: it takes one of the 32 a2cFullP{0-31}.s files thru STDIN, opens the 32 c2fFullO.{0-31}.tch files for reading, and writes a corresponding a2fFullP.{0-31}.tch file based on the a2c file number. The lines of the file being `author_id;file1;file2;file3...`  

Example usage: `UNIX> zcat /da0_data/basemaps/gz/a2cFullP0.s | ./a2fBinSorted.perl 0`

We can modify this program so that it will write the earliest commit dates made by that author for those files, which will become useful for a2L.py later on. To accomplish this, we will have the program additionally read from the c2taFullP.{0-31}.tch files so we can get the time of each commit made by a given author:  
```
my %c2ta;
for my $s (0..($sections-1)){
	tie %{$c2ta{$s}}, "TokyoCabinet::HDB", "/fast/c2taFullP.$s.tch", TokyoCabinet::HDB::OREADER |
	TokyoCabinet::HDB::ONOLCK,
	   16777213, -1, -1, TokyoCabinet::TDB::TLARGE, 100000
	or die "cant open fast/c2taFullP.$s.tch\n";
}
```
We will also ensure the files to be written will have the relationship a2ft as oppposed to a2f:  
```
my %a2ft;
tie %a2ft, "TokyoCabinet::HDB", "/data/play/dkennard/a2ftFullP.$part.tch", TokyoCabinet::HDB::OWRITER | 
     TokyoCabinet::HDB::OCREAT,
	16777213, -1, -1, TokyoCabinet::TDB::TLARGE, 100000
	or die "cant open /data/play/dkennard/a2ftFullP.$part.tch\n";
```
Another important part of the file we want to change is inside the `output` function:  
```
sub output {
	my $a = $_[0];
	my %fs;
	for my $c (@cs){
		my $sec =  segB ($c, $sections);
		if (defined $c2f{$sec}{$c} and defined $c2ta{$sec}{$c}){
			my @fs = split(/\;/, safeDecomp ($c2f{$sec}{$c}, $a), -1);
			my ($time, $au) = split(/\;/, $c2ta{$sec}{$c}, -1);  #add this for grabbing the time
			for my $f (@fs){
				if (defined $time and (!defined $fs{$f} or $time < $fs{$f})){ #modify condition to grab earliest time
					$fs{$f} = $time;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	$a2ft{$a} = safeComp (join ';', %fs); #changed
}
```
Now when we run the new program, it should write individual a2ftFullP.{0-31}.tch files with the format:  
`author_id;file1;file1_timestamp;file2;file2_timestamp;...`  

We can then create a new PATHS dictionary entry in oscar.py, as well as making another function under the Author class to read our newly-created .tch files:  
```
In PATHS dictionary:
...
'author_file_times': ('/data/play/dkennard/a2ftFullP.{key}.tch', 5)
...

In class Author(_Base):
...
@cached_property
def file_times(self):
	data = decomp(self.read_tch('author_file_times'))
	return tuple(file for file in (data and data.split(";")))
...
```

#### Part 2 -- Creating a2L.py
Our next task involves creating a2LFullP{0-31}.s files utilizing the new .tch files we have just created. We want these files to have each line filled with the author name, each year, and the language counts for each year. A possible format could look something like this:  
`"tim.bentley@gmail.com" <>;year2015;2;py;31;js;30;year2016;1;py;29;year2017;8;c;2;doc;1;py;386;html;6;sh;1;js;3;other;3;build;1`  
where the number after each year represents the number of languages used for that year, followed by pairs of languages and the number of files written in that language for that year. As an example, in the year 2015, Tim Bentley made initial commits to files in 2 languages, 31 of which were in Python, and 30 of which were in JavaScript.  

There is a number of things that have to happen to get to this point, so lets break it down:  

* Iterating Author().file_times and grouping timestamps into year 

We will start by reading in a a2cFullP{0-31}.s file to get a list of authors, which we then hold as a tuple in memory and start building our dictionary:  
```
a2L[author] = {}
file_times = Author(author).file_times
for j in range(0,len(file_times),2):
	try:
		year = str(datetime.fromtimestamp(float(file_times[j+1]))).split(" ")[0].split("-")[0]
	#have to skip years either in the 20th century or somewhere far in the future
	except ValueError:
		continue
	#in case the last file listed doesnt have a time
	except IndexError:
		break
	year = specifier + year #specifier is the string 'year'
	if year not in a2L[author]:
		a2L[author][year] = []
	a2L[author][year].append(file_times[j])
```
The datetime.fromtimestamp() function will turn this into a datetime format: `year-month-day hour-min-sec` which we split by a space to get the first half `year-month-day` of the string, and then split again to get `year`.  

* Detecting the language of a file based on file extension
```
for year, files in a2L[author].items():
	build_list = []
	for file in files:
		la = "other"
		if re.search("\.(js|iced|liticed|iced.md|coffee|litcoffee|coffee.md|ts|cs|ls|es6|es|jsx|sjs|co|eg|json|json.ls|json5)$",file):
			la = "js"
		elif re.search("\.(py|py3|pyx|pyo|pyw|pyc|whl|ipynb)$",file):
			la = "py"
		elif re.search("(\.[Cch]|\.cpp|\.hh|\.cc|\.hpp|\.cxx)$",file):
			la = "c"
	.......
```
The simplest way to check for a language based on a file extension is to use the re module for regular expressions. If a given file matches a certain expression, like `.py`, then that file was written in Python. `la = other` if no matches were found in any of those searches. We then keep track of these languages and put each language in a list `build_list.append(la)`, and count how many of those languages occurred when we looped through the files `build_list.count(lang)`. The final format for an author in the a2L dictionary will be `a2L[author][year][lang] = lang_count`.  

* Writing each authors information into the file

See [a2L.py](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/a2L.py) for how information is written into each file.  

Usage: `UNIX> python a2L.py 2` for writing `a2LFullP2.s`  

#### Implementing the application
Now that we have our a2L files, we can run some interesting statistics as to how significant language usage changes over time for different authors. The program [langtrend.py](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/langtrend.py) runs the chi-squared contingency test (via the stats.chi2_contingency() function from scipy module) for authors from an a2LFullP{0-31}.s file and calculates a p-value for each pair of years for each language for each author.   
This p-value means the percentage chance that you would find another person (say out of 1000 people) that has this same extreme of change in language use, whether that be an increase or a decrease. For example, if a given author editied 300 different Python files in 2006, but then editied 500 different Java files in 2007, the percentage chance that you would see this extreme of a change in another author is very low. In fact, if this p-value is less than 0.001, then the change in language use between a pair of years is considered "significant".  

In order for this p-value to be a more accurate approximation, we need a larger sample size of language counts. When reading the a2LFullP{0-31}.s files, you may want to rule out people who dont meet certain criteria:  

* the author has at least 5 consecutive years of commits for files
* the author has edited at least 100 different files for all of their years of commits

If an author does not meet this criteria, we would not want to consider them for the chi-squared test simply because their results would be "uninteresting" and not worth investigating any further.  

Here is one of the authors from the programs output:

Although it is currently not implemented, one could take this one step further and visually represent an authors language changes on a graph, which would be simpler to interpret as opposed to viewing a long list of p values such as the one shown above.  

## Activity S2: Useful Python imports for applications
### subprocess
Simlar to the C version, system(), this module allows you to run UNIX processes, and also allows you to gather any input, output, or error from those processes, all from within a Python script. This module becomes especially useful when you are looking for specific lines out of a .s/.gz file, as opposed to reading the entire file which takes more time.  
A good example usage for subprocess is when we read the c2bPtaPkgO$LANG.{0-31}.gz files for first-time AI module imports in popmods.py. Rather than reading one of these files in its entirety, we look for lines of the file that have a specific module we are looking for.  
```
for i in range(32):
	print("Reading gz file number " + str(i))
	command = "zcat /data/play/" + dir_lang + "thruMaps/c2bPtaPkgO" + dir_lang + "." + str(i) + ".gz"
	p1 = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
	p2 = subprocess.Popen("egrep -w " + module, shell=True, stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE) 
	output = p2.communicate()[0]
```
We can then iterate the lines of this output accordingly, and gather the pieces of information we need:  
```
for entry in str(output).rstrip('\n').split("\n"):
	entry = str(entry).split(";")
	repo, time = entry[1], entry[2]
```

Additional documentation on subprocess can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html).

### re
The re (Regular Expression) module is another useful import for pattern-matching in strings.  
Addtional re documentation can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html).

### matplotlib
Useful graphing module for creating visual representations.  
Extensive documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/).  

## Activity S3: a comparison of oscar.py vs. Perl scripts

When it comes to creating new relationship files (.tch/.s files), using Perl over Python for large data-reading is more time-saving overall. This situation occurred in the complex application we covered where we modified an existing Perl file to get the initial commit times of each file for each author, rather than using Python to accomplish this task.  
Before making this decision, one of our team members decided to run a test between 2 programs, [a2ft.py](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/a2ft.py) and [a2ft.perl](https://bitbucket.org/swsc/lookup/src/master/a2ft.perl). These programs were run at the same time for a period of 10 minutes. Both programs had the same task of retrieving the earliest commit times for each file under each author from a2cFullP{0-31}.s files. The Python version calls the `Commit_info().time_author` and `Commit().changed_file_names` functions from oscar.py. The Perl version ties each of the 32 c2fFullO.{0-31}.tch (Commit().changed_file_names) and c2taFullP.{0-31}.tch (Commit_info().time_author) files into 2 different Perl hashes (Python dictionary equivalent), %c2f and %c2ta. The speed difference between Perl and Python was quite surprising:  

```
[username@da3]/data/play/dkennard% ll a2ftFullP0TEST1.s
-rw-rw-r--. 1 dkennard dkennard 980606 Jul 22 11:56 a2ftFullP0TEST1.s
[username@da3]/data/play/dkennard% ll a2ftFullPTEST2.0.tch
-rw-r--r--. 1 dkennard dkennard 663563424 Jul 22 11:56 a2ftFullPTEST2.0.tch
```  

Within this 10 minute period, the Python version only wrote 980,606 bytes of data into the TEST1 file shown above, whereas the Perl version wrote 663,563,424 bytes into the TEST2 file.  
The main reason oscar.py is slower, in theory, is because oscar.py has more private function calls that it has to perform in order to calculate the key (0-31) and locate where the requested information is stored. Upon further inspection of the [oscar.py](https://github.com/ssc-oscar/oscar.py/blob/master/oscar.py) functions that are called, we can see that there are between 6-7 function calls for each lookup. All of these function calls cause function overhead and thus increase the amount of time to retrieve data for multiple entities.  
In the Perl version of a2ft, the program simply calls `segB()`, which calculates the key of where the information is stored. The function takes a string and the number 32 as arguments (ex. segB(commit_sha, 32)):   

```
sub segB {
	my ($s, $n) = @_;
	return (unpack "C", substr ($s, 0, 1))%$n;
}
```  

Because the %c2f and %c2ta Perl hashes are tied to their respective .tch files, we can then check if a specific commit in a specific number section is defined:  

```
for my $c (@cs){	#where cs is a list of commits for an author and c is one of those commits
	my $sec =  segB ($c, $sections);
	if (defined $c2f{$sec}{$c} and defined $c2ta{$sec}{$c}){
		...
	}
	...
}
```

This is not to say that oscar.py is inefficient and should not be utilized, but it is not the optimal solution for creating new .tch or .s relationship files. oscar.py solely provides a Python interface for gathering requested data out of the respective .tch files and not for mass-reading all 32 files. It also provides simple function calls that were mentioned earlier in the tutorial for retrieving bits of information at a time in a more convenient way.


## Activity S4: Plumbing of WoC

We can obtain a diff for any commit. It requires comparing trees of it and its parent:

Lets find the diff for 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a: 
```
[username@da0]~% echo 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a | ssh da4 ~/lookup/cmputeDiff2.perl 
009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a;/sys/dev/pccbb/pccbb_isa.c;9d5818e25865797b96e4783b00b45f800423e527;594dc8cb2ce725658377bf09aa0f127183b89f77
009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a;/sys/dev/pccbb/pccbb_pci.c;b3c1363c90de7823ec87004fe084f41d0f224c9b;4155935a98ba3b5d3786fa1b6d3d5aa52c6de90a
```
We can see it modifying two files.

### Exercise

Calculate the change made to /sys/dev/pccbb/pccbb_isa.c by commit 009d7b6da9c4419fe96ffd1fffb2ee61fa61532a.

Hint1: Get the old and new blob for  /sys/dev/pccbb/pccbb_isa.c

Hint2: Use shell redirect output '>' to save the content of each blob

Hint3: Use unix diff to calculate the difference
```
[username@da0]~% diff old new
```

## Iterating over a dataset

Sometimes, iterating over the entire dataset using the already created basemaps is the only way to retrieve the desired information. The basemappings from one datatype to another are key-value pairings of data. As such, the retrieval of the entire dataset can usually be done in one pass over one of the already created basemaps.

For example, if the goal was to determine information pertaining to each author in WoC, simply iterating over one of the many basemaps from author to some other dataset e.g. (a2b, a2c, etc) will serve. Since these datasets are a key-value mapping from author to another dataset, this guarantees that each of the keys will be one of the unique authors in WoC. From there, the desired information about that specific author can be determined. 

Below is a Perl script template that allows for retrieval of all the authors from a2c. 

-----------------------
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -I /home/audris/lookup -I /home/audris/lib64/perl5 -I /home/audris/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl -I /usr/local/lib64/perl5 -I /usr/local/share/perl5
use strict;

---------------
This script simply prints each WoC authors name. This helps illustrate how to go about retrieving the keys in a key-value basemap using Perl, but lacks any practical use on it's own.

Notice in this script the $split is defined to be 32 and the for loop iterates from 0 to 31. The reason for this is because of how the data is stored in the basemaps. Each basemap from one data type to another is split into 32 roughly equal parts based on their hashes. As such, in order to iterate over the entire data set, it is neccesary to look at each of these files separately.

From there, Perl allows for direct tying to each of these files in the format of a hash. Because the basemappings are saved using TokyoCabinet, it requires them to be opened using TokyoCabinet to retrieve the data.

Once the hash is tied to the mapping, iterating over the hash can be done, and retrieval of the information simply becomes accessing the elements.

## Mongo Database

On the da1 server, there is a MongoDB server holding some relevant data. This data includes some information that was used for data analysis in the past. Mongo provides an excellent place to store relatively small data without requiring relational information.

On the Mongo server within the WoC database, there are some collections provided that store previously useful data. These collections store relevant metadata on the mass datatypes e.g. (authors, projects, etc). 

### MongoDB Access

When on the da1 server, you can gain access to the MongoDB server simply by running the command 'mongo', or, when on any other da server, you can gain access by running 'mongo --host "da1.eecs.utk.edu"'.

Once on the server, you can see all the available databases using the "show dbs" command. However, the database that pertains primarily to the WoC is the WoC database. 

You can switch to the WoC database, or any other, using the 'use "database name"' command, E.G. (use WoC), and, after switching, you can view the available collections in the database by using the 'show collections' command. 

Currently, there is an author metadata collection (auth_metadata.P) that contains the total number of projects an author has participated in, the total number of blobs created, the total number of commits made, the total number of files they have created, the distribution of languages used by that author, and the first and last time the author committed to Git in Unix Timestamp based on the data contained on version P of WoC.

Alongside this, there is a similar collection for projects on WoC (proj_metadata.P) that contains the total number of authors on the project, the total number of commits, the total number of files, the distribution of languages used, the first and last time there was a commit to the project in Unix Timestamp based on version P of WoC, the number of stars GitHub has given that project (if any), if the project is a fork, and where it was forked from (if anywhere).

To see data in one of the collections, you can run the 'db."collection name".findOne()' command. This will show the first element in the collection and should help clarify what is in the collection.

When the above findOne() command is run on the auth_metadata.P collection, the output is as follows:

-----------
```
mongos> db.auth_metadata.P.findOne() 
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5e0f87416450a4c9c14b34b7"),
        "numCommits" : "8",
        "authorID" : "  <mahisj7@gmail.com>",
        "numBlobs" : "70",
        "earliestCommitDate" : "1418274391",
        "fileInfo" : "{ 'total_javascript_files' => 17,'total_files' => 119,'total_other_files' => 102 }",
        "latestCommitDate" : "1418995004",
        "numProjects" : "1"
}
    
```
---------------

This metadata can then be parsed for the desired information.

Python, like most other programming languages, has an interface with Mongo that makes for data storage/retrieval much simpler. When retrieving or inputting large amounts of data onto the servers, it is almost always faster and easier to do so through one of the interfaces provided.


### PyMongo

PyMongo is an import for Python that simplifies access to the database and elements inside of it. When accessing the server you must first provide which Mongo Client you wish to connect to. For our server, the host will be "mongodb://da1.eecs.utk.edu/". 
This will allow access to the data already saved and will allow for creation of new data if desired. 

From there, accessing databases inside of the client becomes as simple as treating the desired database as an element inside the client. The same is true for accessing collections inside of a database. 
The below code illustrates this process.

--------
```python
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://da1.eecs.utk.edu/")

db = client["WoC"]                                                    
coll = db["auth_metadata"]
```
-------

#### Data Retrieval using PyMongo

When attempting to retrieve data, iterating over the entire collection for specific info is often neccesary. This is done most often through a mongo specific data structure called cursors. However, cursors have a limited life span. After roughly 10 minutes of continuous connection to the server, the cursor is forcibly disconnected. This is to limit the possible number of idle cursors connected to the server at any time. 

Taking this into consideration, if the process may take longer than that, it is neccesary to define the cursor as undying. If this is neccesary, manual disconnection of the cursor after it's served it's purpose is required as well.
The below code illustrates creation and iteration over the collection with a cursor.

--------
```python
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://da1.eecs.utk.edu/")

db = client["WoC"]                                                    
coll = db["auth_metadata"]

dataset = col.find({}, cursor_no_timeout=True)
for data in dataset:
   ...

dataset.close()
```
-------

Once data retrieval has begun, accessing the specific information desired is simple. 
For example, provided above is the information saved in one element of auth_metadata. If access to the AuthorID of each cursor is desired, the "AuthorID" can be treated as the key in a key value-mapping. However, it is often neccesary to consider how the data is stored.

Most often, when storing data in Mongo, it will be stored in Mongo specific format called BSON. BSON objects are saved in unicode. Working with unicode can be an issue if printing needs to be done. As such, decoding from unicode must to be done. Below illustrates a small program that prints each AuthorID from the auth_metadata collection.

----------
```python
import pymongo
import bson

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://da1.eecs.utk.edu/")
db = client ['WoC']
coll = db['auth_metadata']

dataset = coll.find({}, no_cursor_timeout=True)
for data in dataset:
    a = data["AuthorID"].encode('utf-8').strip()
    print(a)

dataset.close()

```
----------

When retrieving data, it is often neccesary to narrow the results. This is possible directly through Mongo when querying for information. For instance, if all the data is not needed in the auth_metadata, just the TotalCommits and the AuthorID, the query can be restricted adding parameters to the find call. An example query is provided below.

----------
```python
dataset = coll.find({}, {"AuthorID": 1, "TotalCommits": 1, "_id": 0}, no_cursor_timeout=True)

for data in dataset:
    print(data)
    
dataset.close()
```
---------

This specific call allows for direct printing of the data, however, as noted above, the names are saved in BSON and as such will be printed in unicode. The first 10 results are shown below.

-------------
```
{u'TotalCommits': 1, u'AuthorID': u'  <mvivekananda@virtusa.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <1151643598@163.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <1615638456@qq.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <182036137@qq.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <1974193036@qq.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <200sc@SomethingStupid.localdomain>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <213>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 1, u'AuthorID': u' <3sodn@yuki.localdomain>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 21, u'AuthorID': u' <625605841@qq.com>'}
{u'TotalCommits': 0, u'AuthorID': u' <712641411@qq.com>'}

```
--------------

Sometimes, restricting the data even further is neccesary. Notice above that many of the users have 0 commits. Exclusion of these entries may be desired. The below example illustrates a way to restrict the results to only users with greater than 0 commits.

----------
```python
dataset = coll.find({"TotalCommits : { "$gt" : 0 } }, 
				     {"AuthorID": 1, "TotalCommits": 1, "_id": 0}, 
				     no_cursor_timeout=True)

for data in dataset:
    print(data)
```
---------

## Accesing by time slices

To access collection indexed by time we use clickhouse databse:
https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/getting_started/tutorial/


It has interfaces to various languages but the key is super fast indexing and the ability to distribute data over a cluster of da servers.

Since only commits have time associated with them, we start from storing all commits in the database. We store only a subset of commits on each server, first we create a table local to each server (commits) and a table that represents all servers (commits_a):
```
for h in da0 da1 da2 da3 da4; 
do echo "CREATE TABLE commits (date Date, sha1 FixedString(20), time Int32, tree FixedString(20), author String, parent String, comment String, content String) ENGINE = MergeTree(date, (sha1), 8192)" |clickhouse-client --host=$h
  echo "CREATE TABLE commits_a AS commits ENGINE = Distributed(da, default, commits, rand())" | clickhouse-client --host=$h
done
```

Then we import data into each of these five tables:
```
#illustyreated for da4
for i in {4..127..5}
do time ~/lookup/importCmt.perl $i | clickhouse-client --max_partitions_per_insert_block=1000 --host=da4 --query 'INSERT INTO commits FORMAT RowBinary'
done 
```

Once the data is in there we can query it
```
clickhouse-client --host=da3 --query 'select count (*) from commits_a'
1830088337
```

It works fast if we specify specific time or an interval:
```
clickhouse-client --host=da3 --query 'select author,comment from commits_a where time=1568656268'

```


We can create additional tables, so that the time filtering could be fast, for example for projects:

```
clickhouse-client --max_partitions_per_insert_block=1000 --host=da3 --query "CREATE TABLE c2p_$i (date Date, sha1 FixedString(20), np UInt32, p String) ENGINE = MergeTree(date, sha1, 8192)"
for j in {3..31..4}; do time ./importc2p.perl $j | clickhouse-client --max_partitions_per_insert_block=1000 --host=da3 --query "INSERT INTO c2p_$j (date, sha1, np, p) FORMAT RowBinary"; done 
```

## Python Clickhouse API

There are classes in oscar.py that allow for querying the clickhouse database:  
1. `Time_commit_info(tb_name='commits_all', db_host='localhost')` - commits
	* `.commit_counts(start, end=None)` - get the count of the commits given a time interval
	* `.commits_iter(start, end=None)` - get the commits as 'Commit' objects in a generator
	* `.commits_shas(start, end=None)` - get the sha1 of the commits in a list
	* `.commits_shas_iter(start, end=None)` - get the sha1 of the commits in a generator
2. `Time_projects_info(tb_name='projects_all', db_host='localhsot')` - \*projects
	* `.get_values_iter(cols, start, end)` - query columns given a time interval (generator)
	* `.project_timeline(cols, repo)` - query columns of a given project name, sorted by time (generator)
	* `.author_timeline(cols, author)` - query columns of a given author, sorted by time (generator)
	
\*note that the *projects_all* table currently does not contain projects that uses the following programming languages: php, rb, Lisp, Sql, Fml, Swift, Lua, Cob, Erlang

The structures of the databases are listed below:  
**commits_all:**  
| name    | type            |
|---------|-----------------|
| sha1    | FixedString(20) |
| time    | Int32           |
| tree    | FixedString(20) |
| author  | String          |
| parent  | String          |
| comment | String          |
| content | String          |

**projects_all:**  
| name     | type            |
|----------|-----------------|
| sha1     | FixedString(20) |
| time     | Int32           |
| blob     | FixedString(20) |
| language | String          |
| repo     | String          |
| author   | String          |
| deps     | String          |

We can use the `commit_counts` to query the count of the commits given a time interval:
```python
>>> from oscar import Time_commit_info
>>>
>>> t = Time_commit_info()
>>> t.commit_counts(1568656268)
8 
```

The `commits_shas_iter` can be used to iterate through commits given a time interval:
```python
>>> t = Time_commit_info()
>>> for sha1 in t.commits_shas_iter(1568656268):
...     print(sha1)
0a8b6216a42e84d7d1e56661f63e5205d4680854
874d92e732d79d0d8bafb1d1bcc76a3b6d81302f
ccf1a5847661de2df791a5a962e3499a478f48ab
39927c70a99f0949c1de3d65a2693c8768bc4e0f
fbb7add2a58b733a797d97a1e63cb8661702d0a3
...
```

The `projects_all` table stores the information associated to each **commit**.  
For `projects_all` table, `get_values_iter` queries for columns in a given time interval:
```python
>>> from oscar import Time_project_info as Proj
>>> p = Proj()
>>> rows = p.get_values_iter(['time','repo'], 1568571909, 1568571910)
>>> for row in rows:
...     print(row)
...
(1568571909, 'mrtrevanderson_CECS_424')
(1568571909, 'gitlab.com_surajpatel_tic_toc_toe')
(1568571909, 'gitlab.com_surajpatel_tic_toc_toe')
...
```
`project_timeline` can be used to query for a specific repository. The result shows the time of the commit and the name of the commit repo sorted by time:
```python
>>> rows = p.project_timeline(['time','repo'], 'mrtrevanderson_CECS_424')
>>> for row in rows:
...     print(row)
...
(1568571909, 'mrtrevanderson_CECS_424')
(1568571909, 'mrtrevanderson_CECS_424')
(1568571909, 'mrtrevanderson_CECS_424')
...
```

It might be useful to examine the dependencies (i.e. includes in C or imports in Python) for each commit.  
The snippet below shows the time, repo name, language, and dependencies for each commit. Note that the commits are sorted by time and the dependencies are separated by semicolon.
```python
>>> rows = p.get_values_iter(['time', 'repo', 'language', 'deps'], 1568571915, 1568571916)
>>> for row in rows:
...     print(row)
...
(1568571916, 'Nakwendaa_neural-network', 'PY', 'numpy\n')
(1568571916, 'Nakwendaa_neural-network', 'PY', 'os;pickle;numpy;time;matplotlib.pyplot;gzip;Mlp.Mlp\n')
```  
Similarily, `author_timeline` queries for a specific author:
```python
>>> rows = p.author_timeline(['time', 'repo'], 'Andrew Gacek <andrew.gacek@gmail.com>')
>>> for row in rows:
...     print(row)
...
(49, 'smaccm_camera_demo')
(677, 'smaccm_vm_hack')
(1180017188, 'teyjus_teyjus')
...
```
## Environment Variable Configuration for OSCAR
Environment variables can be used to tell oscar where to look for data files and set its version. The default paths for data files are:
```python
PATHS = {
    # data_type: (path, prefix_bit_length)
    # prefix length means that the data are split into 2**n files,
    # e.g. key is in 0..31 for prefix length of 5 bit.

}
```  
There are 6 general environment variables:  
1. `OSCAR_ALL_BLOBS`:
	* `commit_sequential_idx`
	* `commit_sequential_bin`
	* `tree_sequential_idx`
	* `tree_sequential_bin`
	* `tag_data`
	* `commit_data`
	* `tree_data`
	* `blob_data`
2. `OSCAR_ALL_SHA1C`:
	* `commit_random`
	* `tree_random` 
3. `OSCAR_ALL_SHA1O`:
	* `blob_offset`
	* `commit_offset`
	* `tree_offset`
4. `OSCAR_BASEMAPS`:
	* `commit_projects`
	* `commit_children`
	* `commit_time_author`
	* `commit_root`
	* `commit_parent`
	* `author_commits`
	* `author_projects`
	* `project_authors`
	* `commit_head`
	* `commit_blobs`
	* `commit_files`
	* `project_commits`
	* `blob_commits`
	* `blob_authors`
	* `file_commits`
	* `file_blobs`
	* `blob_files`
	* `author_trpath`
5. `OSCAR_ALL_SHA1`: 
	* `blob_index_line`
	* `tree_index_line`
	* `commit_index_line`
	* `tag_index_line`
6. `OSCAR_BASEMAPS_VER`:
	* Version of all basemaps  
	
For environment variable 1-5, each will be responsible for a group of data files.  

For example, if the environment variable `OSCAR_ALL_SHA1C` is set to `/mydir/mysubdir`, then it will change the path for  `commit_random` and `tree_random`. Specifically:  
Change the path for `commit_random` to `/mydir/mysubdir/commit_{key}.tch`  
Change the path for `tree_random` to `/mydir/mysubdir/tree_{key}.tch`  

Each individual data file path can be configured by the `OSCAR_{PATHS name}` environment variable.  

For example, if the environment variable `OSCAR_COMMIT_RANDOM` is set to `/foo/bar`, then it will change the path for `commit_random`. Specifically:  
Change the path for `commit_random` to `/foo/bar/commit_{key}.tch`  
The path for `tree_random` remains `/mydir/mysubdir/tree_{key}.tch`  
**Note that the individual file configuration always overwrites the general configuration.**  

The `OSCAR_BASEMAPS_VER` environment variable specifies which version of the basemaps to use. It will change the version for **all** basemaps.

Each individual basemap version can be configured via the `OSCAR_{basemap name}_VER` variable.  

For example, if the environment variable `OSCAR_BLOB_FILES_VER` is set to `Q`, then the version `Q` of the `blob_files` basemap will be used. This overwrites the version set by the `OSCAR_BASEMAPS_VER`.
